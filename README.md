# Ray Tracing in C++

Based on [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

<img src="./image.png" alt="Image of a large collection of spheres on a grey surface.  Three large spheres dominate the scene, the first made of a solid metallic material, reflects smaller spheres.  The second large sphere, partly obscured by the first, appears to be made of a refractive material, with the reflection inverted.  The final large sphre, again partly obscured is solid and made of a fuzzy, matte, brown material.  The smaller spheres, of which there are dozens, are of varying matrials and colours.">

To run:

```shell
make  && ./main > image.ppm && open image.ppm
```
